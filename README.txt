This small scale project was made with html vanilla css and js , and as for the backend (hosting and database) i used firebase and its firestore database to store orders , user data and products. Also using firebase i set up a user authentication system for logins/signup on main site. 

On admin site you can create products and add them to main site to be displayed.
