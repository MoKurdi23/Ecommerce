This small scale project was made with html vanilla css and js , and as for the backend (hosting and database) i used firebase and its firestore database to store orders , user data and products. Also using firebase i set up a user authentication system for logins/signup on main site. 

On admin site you can create products and add them to main site to be displayed, view registered users , and view orders by clicking on each order to get a card that contains info of that order.

On main site you can view products and add them to a cart then manage that cart, you can register and login , you can utilise the search bar and search for a specific product , on cart you can go to checkout where you fill your info so that your order is processed  and can be viewed on the admin page in a card that contains all order info.

Code for the admin portal site is available in the 'admin' folder, and code for the main site is available in the 'public' folder
